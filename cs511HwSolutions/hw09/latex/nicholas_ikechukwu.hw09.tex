\section*{Exercise 1. Open EML.Chapter 6.pdf: Do Exercise 107 on page 64. }


\begin{mdframed}
    Exercise 107: (Two-Colorability of Graphs: First-Order Deﬁnable). The notion of two-colorable
    simple graphs coincides with the notion of bipartite simple graphs. Write an inﬁnite set $\Gamma_{bipartite}$
    of ﬁrst-order sentences such that, for every simple graph G, it holds that G $\models$ $\Gamma_{bipartite}$ iﬀ G is
    bipartite.

    \vspace{1em} 
    Hint: G is bipartite iﬀ every cycle in G (possibly with repeated vertices) has even length. 
\end{mdframed}
\section*{Solution:}
Let $\Gamma_{\text{bipartite}}$ be the set of first-order sentences that express that for every cycle of length $n$ (where $n$ is odd), such a cycle cannot exist in the graph. For each odd $n \geq 3$, we include a sentence $\phi_n$ in $\Gamma_{\text{bipartite}}$:
    
    \[
    \phi_n := \forall x_1 \ldots \forall x_n \left(\bigwedge_{i=1}^{n-1} E(x_i,x_{i+1}) \land E(x_n,x_1) \rightarrow \bigvee_{1 \leq i < j \leq n} x_i \approx x_j\right)
    \]
    
    Then:
    \[
    \Gamma_{\text{bipartite}} := \{\phi_n \mid n \geq 3 \text{ and } n \text{ is odd}\}
    \]
    
    This works because:
\begin{proof}
    
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Each $\phi_n$ says "there cannot be a cycle of length $n$" where $n$ is odd
        \item The formula enforces that if we have $n$ vertices connected in a cycle, at least two must be the same vertex
        \item A graph models $\Gamma_{\text{bipartite}}$ if and only if it has no odd cycles
        \item By the characterization of bipartite graphs, a graph is bipartite if and only if it has no odd cycles
    \end{itemize}
    
    Therefore, $G \models \Gamma_{\text{bipartite}}$ if and only if $G$ is bipartite.
\end{proof}

\section*{Exercise 2. [LCS, page 163]: Do Exercise 2.4.6 (the last on that page).}

\begin{mdframed}
    Consider the three sentences:
    
    \vspace{1em}
    $\phi1 \defeq \forall x P (x, x)$
    
    \vspace{1em}
    $\phi2 \defeq \forall x \forall y (P (x, y) \implies P (y, x))$
    
    \vspace{1em}
    $\phi3 \defeq \forall x \forall y \forall z ((P (x, y) \land P (y, z) \implies P (x, z)))$
    
    \vspace{1em}

    which express that the binary predicate P is reﬂexive, symmetric and transitive,
    respectively. Show that none of these sentences is semantically entailed by the
    other ones by choosing for each pair of sentences above a model which satisﬁes
    these two, but not the third sentence – essentially, you are asked to ﬁnd three
    binary relations, each satisfying just two of these properties. 
  
\end{mdframed}

\subsection*{Solution:}
We can show that none of these sentences semantically entails the others, by first finding three different models:
    
\vspace{1em}
1. A model satisfying $\phi_2$ and $\phi_3$ but not $\phi_1$ (symmetric and transitive but not reflexive)

2. A model satisfying $\phi_1$ and $\phi_3$ but not $\phi_2$ (reflexive and transitive but not symmetric)

3. A model satisfying $\phi_1$ and $\phi_2$ but not $\phi_3$ (reflexive and symmetric but not transitive)


\vspace{1em}
Now, we'll construct these models using simple binary relations on small sets:
    
\vspace{1em}

\textbf{Model 1:} (symmetric and transitive but not reflexive)
\begin{itemize}
    \item Domain: $A = \{1, 2\}$
    \item Relation: $P = \emptyset$ (empty relation)
    \item This is symmetric (vacuously) and transitive (vacuously) but not reflexive since $P(1,1)$ and $P(2,2)$ don't hold   ß
\end{itemize}

    
\textbf{Model 2:} (reflexive and transitive but not symmetric)

\begin{itemize}
\item Domain: $A = \{1, 2\}$
    \item Relation: $P = \{(1,1), (2,2), (1,2)\}$
    \item This is reflexive (all $(x,x)$ included) and transitive, but not symmetric since $(1,2)$ is in $P$ but $(2,1)$ is not
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Model 3:} (reflexive and symmetric but not transitive)
\begin{itemize}
    \item Domain: $A = \{1, 2, 3\}$
    \item Relation: $P = \{(1,1), (2,2), (3,3), (1,2), (2,1)\}$
    \item This is reflexive (all $(x,x)$ included) and symmetric, but not transitive since $(1,2)$ and $(2,3)$ are in $P$ but $(1,3)$ is not
\end{itemize}
    

Therefore, it is clear that each sentence is independent of the others.
